# Drop_Top_Game
Drop Top is a Game I made as a 16 year old high schooler, worked out great

This game consists of a ball falling down into various square shaped obstacles with holes in them
you had to fit through those holes to earn points and the game got faster and faster each time 

It uses the cellphone gyroscope as a controler
